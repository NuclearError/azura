--- Thinking about a more restricted screen size setup so that when the camera follows the player there is less of a slowdown.

- The tilemap vs camera causes slowness. This is possibly also related to the fact that the screen is being dynamically
resized to the screen size.

- An alternative way to size the screens would be to have the game resize to the screen size ONLY on mobile device (or under
a certain screen width or something). On a desktop device, or over a certain size, a fixed screen size should be chosen. The
world itself can be expanded to be bigger to work like the phaser examples online.
