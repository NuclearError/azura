# Azura

## October 2016

The October 2016 branch has been created to get the project going again, with a focus on 'just develop *something*' rather than getting bogged down in refactoring, reading and speculating about the merits of different patterns.

## Decisions made since summer

* Continue developing while following Zenva tutorials, but review the 'Basic' template files provided by PhotonStorm/Phaser on github and apply relevant settings, particularly regarding screen size.
* The game will be primarily treated like a desktop browser game. Access on a mobile device will be accommodated as far as possible, but is not the primary focus.
* Get a game built; worry about code standards etc afterwards.

## To Do

* implement a gulp process
* adjust .gitignore to clean up unnecessary file commits
* refactor the really long if/else logic
