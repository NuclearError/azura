After a hiatus, this branch has been archived for reference only. 

## Ongoing game issues

The original Phaser setup used for this game project was intended to run easily on both a desktop browser
and on a mobile device. While this is true, in practise the game window is treated like a basic responsive website,
meaning that the screen area is simply resized to fit the width of the user's screen. This leads to the obvious problem
of users on a small screen seeing a tiny game with tiny assets, and users on a large screen seeing needlessly huge assets.

Further research into alternative Phaser setups, choosing between developing a browser game, or a mobile game, or both,
has led to a prolonged pause in actual development.

## To Do

* implement a gulp process
* adjust .gitignore to clean up unnecessary file commits
* make a choice on game output above
* continue development
